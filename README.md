DECO2017 Final Assessment - Flowtime tracker and Kanban board hybrid

HOW TO USE

1. Create a new task by clicking the plus icon on any of the boards. Brand new tasks which need to be done should be created in the 'To-do' board, whereas tasks you know you completed not too long ago can be added to the 'Done' board.

2. When about to start a task, either create a new task in the 'Doing' board or drag a task from the 'Todo' board to the 'Doing board'.

3. Press the 'Start' button, and a timer will start. Begin studying, and feel free to use the dictionary and music player if you like. Click 'Stop' when you need to
take a break or you are done with your task.

4. If you have completed a task, drag it to the 'Done' board. Cick the drop-down to view any details regarding the task.



NOTE: A couple times, I sat down to code at my dad's desktop and used PHP storm as the editor (the editor he uses). It's associated with his github account and added him as a contributor to my repository, even when I used my credentials to commit.
